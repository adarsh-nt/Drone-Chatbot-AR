The system can have a remote control station having a route management system operable to determine a flight plan. The system can further have a device configured for unmanned operation having a transceiver operable to receive the flight plan from the remote control station. The device can have a memory operable to store the flight plan and an electromagnetic (EM) map of the enclosed area. The device can have a location determination sensor (LDS) operable to determine a three dimensional position of the device within the enclosed area based on the EM map. The device can then execute the flight plan based on the three dimensional position and the EM map.\n",

      "Abstract: Techniques are described for an autonomous asset management system that integrates autonomous devices, such as drone devices and other robotic devices, with a home security system of a property to enable management, monitoring, and/or tracking of various assets located within the property. In some implementations, an indication of an asset associated with a property is obtained by an autonomous device. Sensor data collected by one or more sensors of the property is obtained by the autonomous device based on the indication of the asset. A present status of the asset is determined by the autonomous device based on the sensor data. A determination that the present status of the asset does not correspond to an expected status of the asset is made by the autonomous device. In response, the autonomous device navigates to the particular location of the property.\n",
